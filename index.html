        <h3 class=typing-text>Where <span>education</span> is valued</h3>

        <p>Millions of children are being raised all over the globe without an education. Even though poverty, conflict, and inequality are contributory factors, lack of parental care is one of the saddest causes. Having no parental care, no parental advice, and no parental support, due to the lack of guidance, support and protection, many children end up vulnerable, being compelled to work, get married when young, and live their lives without the opportunity to learn. The focus of this site is to bring light to their plight. We will be creating awareness and motivating to action, by drawing attention to the consequences of parental care loss, and also covering those more general barriers of bad poverty and displacement. Every child should be given not only a classroom, but also the very nurturing care which enables learning. Collectively, we will be able to work towards a new dawn where every child will be deprived of the right to education.</p>
